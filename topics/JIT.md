# What is Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation?

**Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation** is a technique used to enhance the performance of programming languages by compiling code into machine code (the low-level instructions the CPU understands) at runtime, rather than ahead of time during the initial compilation phase.

In simpler terms, JIT compiles code as it is needed while the program is running, instead of compiling the entire program before execution. This approach blends the flexibility of interpreted languages with the performance benefits of compiled languages.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Run-time Compilation
JIT compiles only the parts of the code needed during execution, rather than the entire program upfront.

### 2. Optimization
JIT compilers optimize based on real-time execution. Frequently called functions can be fine-tuned for performance.

### 3. Speed Improvements
Unused code may be skipped entirely. JIT can recompile and reoptimize as the program continues running.

### 4. Hybrid Approach
Often begins with interpretation. Once "hot spots" are identified, they’re compiled to machine code for better performance.

## How Does JIT Work?

### 1. Interpretation Phase
The code starts executing via an interpreter, converting high-level code to CPU instructions step-by-step.

### 2. Hot Spot Detection
The engine tracks which parts of code are used frequently—these become candidates for JIT compilation.

### 3. Compilation of Hot Spots
These parts are then compiled to native machine code and reused, significantly speeding up further execution.

### 4. Optimizations
JIT performs:
- **Inlining**: Embedding function bodies directly into calling code.
- **Loop unrolling**: Expanding loops to reduce overhead.

### 5. Reuse of Compiled Code
Compiled code is cached and executed directly when needed again, bypassing interpretation.

## Advantages of JIT Compilation

### 1. Faster Execution
Reduced interpretation time for repeated code results in significantly improved speed.

### 2. Adaptive Optimizations
JIT adapts to real-time data like memory usage and call frequency, outperforming static compilation.

### 3. Portability
Can run on any platform with the right JIT engine.

### 4. Dynamic Optimization
JIT continues optimizing the code while the program is running.

## Example: JIT in JavaScript

JavaScript engines (like **V8** and **SpiderMonkey**) use JIT to optimize performance:
```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}

for (let i = 0; i < 1e6; i++) {
  square(i);  // Hot spot: frequently executed
}
```
- Initially interpreted for speed.
- Later compiled and optimized once identified as a hot spot.

## JIT vs. AOT (Ahead-of-Time Compilation)

| Feature            | JIT                           | AOT                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| When Compiled      | At runtime                    | Before execution              |
| Optimization Basis | Real-time program behavior    | Static analysis               |
| Examples           | JavaScript, Java, C#, PyPy    | C, C++, Go                    |

## Real-World JIT Compilers

- **V8** (Chrome, Node.js)
- **JVM** (Java)
- **CLR** (.NET languages like C#)
- **PyPy** (Python)

## Summary

JIT compilation delivers performance close to compiled languages while maintaining the flexibility of interpreters. It enables high-speed execution by compiling only the needed parts of code during runtime and continuously optimizing based on usage patterns.
